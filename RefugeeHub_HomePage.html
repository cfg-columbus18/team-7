 <B>MISSION<B>The Refugee Hub’s mission is to foster justice and human rights for refugees through innovative research, programs, and partnerships.

<B>CONTEXT<B>The Refugee Hub is widely recognized as a high-impact, collaborative organization committed to making a difference for refugees. Since 2012, the University of Ottawa Refugee Hub has played a leading role in developing and implementing creative, collaborative solutions to promote access to justice for refugees and refugee claimants in Canada and around the world. These interventions – diverse in their impacts and beneficiaries – have followed a consistent approach, informed by core principles that continue to influence their work today. They have applied these principles and approaches to create, scale up and implement seven high-impact flagship initiatives in support of access to justice for refugees, along with several smaller time-limited interventions. In the process, they have built a team and an organization that is greater than the sum of its parts – a creative, collaborative organization dedicated to developing, testing and implementing the most impactful solutions for refugee access to justice. In the next 3 to 5 years, the goal of the Refugee Hub is to build on this experience and track-record to deepen and broaden their impact. This will involve not only maintaining and enhancing their current efforts, but also strengthening the connections between them, and launching a dedicated space to explore, test and incubate new access to justice interventions – Hub Innovation Lab. In parallel, they will continue to grow and strengthen the community of practitioners, students, scholars, and others who are connected through their programs, building lasting capacity and access to justice culture in their sector. In pursuing these objectives, they work to continue to cultivate the balance between strategic program development and responsiveness to the needs of the community, while also building the internal processes and infrastructure to adapt and respond to this evolving landscape.
